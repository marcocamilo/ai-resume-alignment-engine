**What to Expect**

**AI Engineering** – You will implement AI systems for various productive application scenarios in the field of Large Language Models within public administration.

**System Development** – Your work will start with AI prototypes that you develop together with experienced AI engineers. Your tasks involve taking systems from the lab into the real world and optimizing their performance.

**Creativity** – When tackling technical problems, you are not afraid to pursue creative solutions. **Responsibility** – You will work in interdisciplinary project teams to solve complex challenges and enjoy implementing AI systems for productive use.

**What You Bring**

- You have successfully completed your studies in (Business) Informatics and have extensive experience in implementing productive AI systems (including references).
- You have developed processes, pipelines, and tools for machine learning (e.g., regression, clustering, neural networks) and have knowledge in data analysis, modeling, and architecture. You are also familiar with best practices in software development, cloud environments, and data science frameworks such as SciKit-learn.
- You have knowledge in deep learning techniques (NLP, time series forecasting), machine learning methods, handling large language models, the RAG methodology, and experience with Python or C++. You also have experience with ML-Ops (model versioning, model and data lineage, monitoring, model hosting, deployment, and scalability). Experience with frameworks like Langchain, LlamaIndex, and FastAPI is a plus.
- Proficiency in German rounds out your profile.
