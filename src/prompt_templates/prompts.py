    • Domain Knowledge: put the specific hard skills and platform-based skills throughout my resume to show that the candidate fits qualifications states in the job description.
    • Impact Statements: include impact statements to showcase whether the candidate improved, optimized, or increased 'XYZ.'

output = """
3. Observe formatting and length considerations

Adjust and optimize the entire resume content to ensure it does not exceed the length of the original resume, as the updated resume should fit within the same space as the original.

Bare in mind the following limitations:
    • You are not allowed to add or remove projects or experiences other than the ones in the resume.
    • You cannot exceed the original length of the resume. This is because the original resume already fits in one page. You must be mindful of the volume of text, ensuring your version has a similar length to the original version.
    • Do not include an objective/professional summary. It is not used anymore.

Return the optimized resume using the same format as provided in the input. Do not include a header for this task.
